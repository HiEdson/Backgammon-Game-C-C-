# ðŸŽ® Backgammon-Game-C_Cpp
Backgammon Console Game
 

In this Project i worked with C and Cpp by applying Random file acess concept in order to update the table(table.dat) information as well as recording the moviments from each player(log.dat) through sequential  file acess techniques
main.cpp: source code
game.dat: last status of the game
log.dat: command log (only valid commands are saved)
main.exe: executable file of the game
